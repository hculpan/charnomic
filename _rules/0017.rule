Players wishing to perform actions that require an election must formally and
explicitly call for a vote on that specific action.  The time period following
that call is referred to as the 'Voting Period', and the player initiating it is
referred to as the 'Legislatorâ€™.  A Voting Period continues until any one of the
following occurs: the measure is formally withdrawn by the Legislator, all
players not on leave have cast a vote, or any calendar rules governing the
measure are obtained.  After this, the Voting Period for that measure ends.
Votes cast before or after the Voting Period of an action will be ignored and
not considered for any purpose within the rules.  A player may change his vote
within the Voting Period, but the Voting Period will not be extended solely to
permit time for players to change their vote.  Actions that require a vote include,
but may not be limited to, the adoption of a proposal.
