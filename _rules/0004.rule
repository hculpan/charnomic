Each player on their turn proposes one rule-change and has it voted on. Each proposal will be given a number starting with 12, and each proposal shall receive the next successive integer whether or not it is adopted. The player will receive a number of points equal to the number of the proposed rule-change multiplied by the fraction of votes in favor, rounding down.
