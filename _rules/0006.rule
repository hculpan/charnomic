A rule-change is adopted if and only if the proposal receives a majority of votes in favor and no votes against.  Any player may choose to abstain from the vote.  If a player fails to vote within 3 days of the vote being called, their vote will be assumed to be an abstention. The voting must be completed within 7 days of the proposalâ€™s initial introduction or the proposal will be rejected.  The proposing player may call for a vote earlier than that, and he or she determines the final form of the proposal to be voted on prior to any votes being cast.
