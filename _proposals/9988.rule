Be it proposed that rule 6 will be changed to remove the text "and no votes against"
from the first line.  The new rule shall read:
<br><br>
<p>A rule-change is adopted if and only if the proposal receives a majority of votes
in favor. Any player may choose to abstain from the vote.
If a player fails to vote within 3 days of the vote being called, their vote will
be assumed to be an abstention. The voting must be completed within 7 days of the
proposalâ€™s initial introduction or the proposal will be rejected. The proposing player
may call for a vote earlier than that, and he or she determines the final form of the
proposal to be voted on prior to any votes being cast.</p>

<em>The intent of this rule is to change passage of a proposal from essentially
unanimous to a simple majority.</em>
